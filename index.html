            <p>Please be patient while this website is being built. It has been a few years since I have worked with raw HTML rather than jekyll or react-UI and I am trying to re-learn what is important in accessibility practices. In addition, I'm still figuring out exactly what it is that I want to say about my past experience that explains why you should bring me on to your team.</p>

            <h2>About</h2>

            <p>I’m a full-stack software engineer with a background in systems development at Northrop Grumman, where I contributed to applications in defense and aerospace. Working in this environment taught me how to build reliable, scalable software under strict requirements and collaborate within multidisciplinary teams where precision and clarity are essential. I had the great pleasure to act as a team leader in our transition to modern version control systems in git and it's integration to our transition to agile development.</p>

            <p>Alongside my engineering work, I’ve spent over a decade as a post-secondary educator, teaching courses such as <a href="https://cu-csci-1300-intro-programming.github.io/spring-2025-web/">Introduction to Programming</a>, Data Structures, Theory of Computation, and Principles of Programming Languages. My background as an educator has honed my skills in breaking down complex technical concepts to communicating them clearly to a range of audiences, whether that’s teammates, customers, or end users. In teaching large, diverse classrooms, I’ve learned how to quickly assess different levels of understanding and adapt explanations in real time. Those same skills transfer directly to software development where shared understanding is critical to project success on cross-functional teams. I have regularly applied these skills when documenting code, reviewing pull requests, mentoring junior developers, or translating technical trade-offs for product managers and non-technical stakeholders.</p>

            <h2>Software</h2>
            <p>Most of my professional background is in developing data storage and access systems for computer-to-computer interactions. In my graduate studies I grew my skills in user centered design and object oriented design to bring a more rounded approach to my software development in future employment.</p>

        <div class="box-safety" id="a11y">
            <h2>A11y</h2>
            <p>A11y is a "numeronym" for "accessibility" used commonly by the technical community that works with accessible technologies (AT) and and standards. In my personal life, I use a screen reader for most of my readings. While I am capable of sighted reading, I often find it fatiguing and prefer to access information through audio formats. I use the text-to-speech feature on Mac wich requires highlighting information. Sometimes it actually keeps highlight tracking for me so that I can follow along with sight, but it's quite inconsistent. I'd like to explore these quirks futher in my research someday.</p>

            <h2>Teaching</h2>
            <p>A special thank you to the mentors that helped me get my start in teaching CSCI 3155 Principles of Programming Langauges at the University of Colorado Boulder, <a href="https://plv.colorado.edu/bec/">Bor-Yuh Evan Chang</a> and <a href="home.cs.colorado.edu/~srirams/">Sriram Sankaranarayanan</a></p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            I quite enjoy yoga as a regular practice to learn to breath through what is difficult in life and stay present in the moment. This is a great hobby that I can practice on a regular basis. When I have more time for an exotic hobby, you can find me under the sea. Below is a picture of a Bobtail squid taken by my dive master on a recent trip to the Philippines.</p>
